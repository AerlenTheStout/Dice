# Dice
## This project is meant to replicate a dice game I played at a friends house

- there are five dice that are be passed around as to many people as wanted
- when it is your turn you get the five dice
- you roll them,

#### Points
- 1's are worth 100 points. 5's are worth 50
- all the other numbers dont have any base value but if you get a run (3, 4, 5 in a row of the same number)
- it is worth (Jack has not gotten back to me) ecept 1 if you get three 1's it is 1000 points

- to get on the board you need at least 1000 points
- before you have 1000 points on the board you cannot keep anything below that 1000 points
  - ex: I have no points on the board and i get 500 points my first roll i cant just keep that i have to roll until I have 1000 points
  - after I have 1000 points in the pot I dont have to roll again and I can keep that 1000
  - now that i have 1000 points on the board I can keep anything under 1000
- if on your roll you do not get any points you pass the dice to the next person rinse and repeat
- if you gain points you can roll again with the dice left
  - ex: i roll a '1 4 3 3 2' I can roll again becasue i got 100 points from the 1
  -  now i re roll the '4 3 3 2' and get '4 6 6 2', i lose the 100 points because i cannot keep anything below 1000 and give the dice to the next person
  -  now after i have 1000 points on the board I dont have to keep rolling until I get 1000
  - ex: if i get 600 points from '6 6 6' i can keep that and i pass the dice to the next person
  -  if you roll all the dice and they all give you points (ex' 1 5 3 3 3 ') those points get stored in a pot (so 100 + 50 + 300 = 450)
  -  now you reroll all the dice and keep adding tom that pot 
  -  next roll i get is '1 4 4 4 2' i lose everything in the pot and pass the dice because i got a 2 which does not have a point value
 
 
> special rule for later about roll off the last person's roll (ASK JACK)
